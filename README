# Getting Started

## Installation

First, install all the necessary packages by running:

```bash
npm install
```

## Starting the Server

To start the server, run:

```bash
npm start
```

## Running the Example Script

Iâ€™ve included a script to send example requests as per the specifications. To execute the script, use:

```bash
./send_request.sh
```

## Important: Database Reset

Before restarting the server, ensure you delete the database to avoid potential issues. This can help prevent conflicts or errors with persistent data.
